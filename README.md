# fabric-trance
The project currently provides the building files, SDK files, business interface files and blockchain network startup scripts of the fabric blockchain network.

If you want to clone the project in reverse and start it locally, you need to modify the certificate path and chain code path in some yaml configuration files in the fabric network to the file path you generated.

In addition, the network startup script in the project is a summary script, which is cloned locally for the first time. It is recommended to open the script file and execute the script command step by step to view the error location.
